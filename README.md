# Landing Page

In this project, I built a multi-section landing page. Often times,
we don't know how much content will be added to a page
through a Content Management System (CSM) or an API. To handle this
problem, we need to be able to add content dynamically to a web page.
This landing page combines JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to update and
control the page and create a dynamic user experience.
